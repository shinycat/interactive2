 	<p>Emoji University has created a demanding, extensive and competitive program. In order to follow in the footsteps of the origianl creater, Kurita, we have implemented his system of design to pass down to the best and the brightest. All areas will be studied and critiqued extensively, such as color, shapes and pyschology. Emoji communication begins from day one. Students and professors communicate strictly with emojis.</p>
